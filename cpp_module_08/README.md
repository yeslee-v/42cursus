# Cpp Module 08

> The goal of these modules is to introduce you to Object-Oriented Programming.
> This will be the starting point of your C++ journey. Many languages are recommended
> to learn OOP. We decided to choose C++ since it’s derived from your old friend C.
> Because this is a complex language, and in order to keep things simple, your code will
> comply with the C++98 standard.
